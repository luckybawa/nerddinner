Some people use &quot;GenericRepository&lt;T&gt; where T: Entity&quot; with GetById, Add, Delete and Update....then, why not just reference ObjectContext directly, its more fast, easy to do, easy to understand. UnitOfWork too...</p>\r\n<p>Services are util sometimes, ie.: Add HistoricalChanges when saving a object.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What you preffer?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Will try it again without the PDF later and then perhaps move to a little test project.....&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Before I go back to NerdDinner, how different is that tutorial in MVC1 to what I am learning in MVC2 - am I better off waiting for the revised documentation. I just am concerned if when I learnt asp.net 1.1 and then 2.0, I wish I had just waited and skipped 1.1. thanks for any help in advance people !!</p>",
