I followed the instructions to use the ADO.Net Entity Data Model. But of course, in VS2008 the Entity Framework does not automatically implement the foreign key relationship. When I\r\n downloaded the VS 2008 solution I see that it does not use the Entity Framework, but uses Link to SQL instead.</p>\r\n<p>a. Is the reason that the VS 2008 solution uses Link to SQL Classes (.dbml) instead of Entities (.edmx), because it doesn't implement the foreign key relationships?</p>\r\n<p>b. Is it possible to get the RSVP sets to work using the Entity Framework, and if so, how would the code have to be written ?</p>\r\n<p>2) The map works based on the address lookup, but the Latitude and Longitude are not getting updated in the database. Any suggestions?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Robert Tanenbaum</p>\r\n",
