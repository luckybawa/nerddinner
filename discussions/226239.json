Wix is nice for Windows apps, but I see no reason to use it for Web Apps when MSDeploy is one line from the command\r\n line and already built in. I did a talk on it at Mix: <a href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WebDeploymentMadeAwesomeIfYoureUsingXCopyYoureDoingItWrong.aspx\">\r\nhttp://www.hanselman.com/blog/WebDeploymentMadeAwesomeIfYoureUsingXCopyYoureDoingItWrong.aspx</a>  </span><span style=\"font-size:9.0pt;font-family:'Verdana','sans-serif';color:gray\"></span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Bottom line - WiX helps software vendors package websites for sale, whereas MSDeploy is for IT professionals and developers. From a Vendors perspective that wants\r\n to earn money by selling websites to customers that have the correct hardware and operation system, but without a technical clue - then WiX is a better way to earn money than MSDeploy. If this is not the case and I've misunderstood the whole point of Windows\r\n Installer, then it would be good to hear about this in a talk sometime.</p>\r\n",
