I thought a repository pattern always has a service layer which calls the repository layer - I was interested why ND doesn't have this??</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also why the repository classes and interfaces are in the same assembly as the MVC app - is it not better practice to separate these?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I would really love to hear some feedback</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>",
