The application is still a simple and easy one, and still a nice code to browse and learn from for beginners, but also can be a base for a websites similar to nerddinner.com.</p>\r\n<p>The current version of the application doesn't (out of the box) support the deployment on other than nerddinner.com wensite for different reasons; e.g. the hard-coded&nbsp;nerddinner.com references and the requirement of installing the application in the\r\n root of the domain; i.e. somedomain.com and not somedomain.com/nerddinner.</p>\r\n<p>What brought that to my mind is that I'm planning to use the application in a website I'm creating, and although the number of changes I need to do to make it work isn't high, I'm concerned about the maintenance effort later (updating to the latest version\r\n and patching the application with the latest bug fixes)&nbsp;and the possibility of code conflicts.</p>\r\n<p>My question is will you accept such changes that will make NerdDinner a &quot;plug-and-play&quot; application or is it a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; kind of application :)</p>\r\n<p>Essam</p>\r\n",
