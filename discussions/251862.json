They're going to clean up the branches of the source control, fix some bugs and get the\r\n issue tracker under control.</p>\r\n<p>We'll move the trunk to MVC3 (while keeping the MVC1 and MVC2 branches) and start adding new stuff like jQuery mobile, better OpenID support, IE9, HTML5 and more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Scott Hanselman</p>\r\n",
