I'm publishing to a local folder on C drive (<span>just files needed by the site</span>).

When I click on \"log on\", \"host a dinner\" or \"about\" links or any other link, I receive a 404 error page:</p>\n<p>HTTP Error 404.0 - Not FoundThe resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.</p>\n<p>I have not changed anything within the config files,&nbsp;ConnectionStrings.config and web.config.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br /> Am I missing somehing?</p>",
