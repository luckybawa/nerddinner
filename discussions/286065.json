I'm trying to change the default location (us) of the Bing map, on the index.cshmtl.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It's not that&nbsp;straightforward&nbsp;as I had imagined. I can see there is a&nbsp;getCurrentLocation() javascript method on index.cshtml, however it seem like this method has not been implemented.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I would prefer if someone could point me in the right direction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In short: I would like to locate the location of the current user, if he is from Sweden then I would like to show a Swedish map, and if from Germany then a map of Germany and so forth.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for reading.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sincerely</p>\r\n<p>Samar</p>\r\n",
