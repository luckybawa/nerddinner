Rather than creating the MDF file in the App_Data folder, you'll use the Server Explorer (or your SQL Studio or whatever your favorite DB utility is) to create the database and tables. Everything else will work as before. When it comes time to do the authorization/authentication stuff, you'll run aspnet_regsql from the command line to make the authorization database. <br>\r\n",
