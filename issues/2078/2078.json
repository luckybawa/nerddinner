    "Description": "The first big reason I moved to MVC, loved it, and would never go back to webforms, is that MVC doesn't get in my way. I think that if you don't care about the quality of your output, you are throwing away at least 60% of the power of MVC.\n\nCheck out your pages with the w3c markup validator: you declare them as xhtml 1.0 strict but they don't validate. This is the validation for the homepage:\nhttp://validator.w3.org/check?verbose=1&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fnerddinner.com%2F\n\n14 errors. Getting the site to validate is but the first step to its quality. You should also consider:\n\n- Using unobtrousive javascript, having nothing on the site depending on it (everything must be usable even without js)\n- Using proper media attributes in your css to avoid screen stylesheet from being used on handheld devices or printers\n- Checking your site for at least basic accessibility rules",
