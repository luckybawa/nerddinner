    "Description": "I was able to crash your nerddinner.com site by giving it a really large id. I guess it threw a stack overflow or something (since I exceeded an int32):\n\nhttp://nerddinner.com/87238478723434343\n\nThe parameters dictionary contains a null entry for parameter 'id' of non-nullable type 'System.Int32' for method 'System.Web.Mvc.ActionResult Details(Int32)' in 'NerdDinner.Controllers.DinnersController'. To make a parameter optional its type should be either a reference type or a Nullable type.\nParameter name: parameters",

I've put one together, I'll try to figure out how to upload a patch.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "Message": "Rather than use a constraint, I simply added a FileNotFound result and changed the parameter to a nullable int. The reason is that if a URL matches everything but the ID, it's almost certain that this is the correct route they indended to match, but they got the id wrong. So it seems that's a good place to show the 404 page wich we should make sure is really helpful.",
