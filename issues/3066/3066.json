I had an email address in there and with a full form, this validation either wasn't getting triggered or just wasn't displaying the phone validation error properly.\r\n\r\nMaybe custom validation - if pattern matches an email validate with an email regex, or if the field starts with an @ let it be a Twitter ID, or if it starts with a number validate under a phone rule of some sort?
