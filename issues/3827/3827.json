    "Description": "I tried to create a dinner for a perfectly valid address that was 51 characters in length, but was unable to do so because the \"string or binary data would be truncated.\"\n\nInteresting note: since this is not a Dinner rule violation, no error message is shown to the user.  The Create form is just redisplayed as if nothing has happened.\n\nThe Address column is currently 50 characters.  Perhaps make it 128 characters?  255?  I don't know, I'm just throwing out random numbers here.",

Based on the many addresses I've worked with, maybe 300 characters at a minimum?  Just an idea...",
