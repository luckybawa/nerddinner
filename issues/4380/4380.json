    "Description": "Neither view (urls below) of a specific dinner displays the iCal link when in my iPhone's Safari browser, as FF3 does on my PC (with the top link - can't get to the bottom link on my PC).\n\nhttp://nerddinner.com/1181\nhttp://nerddinner.com/#_Details\n\nSince my iPhone is the only place I keep my calendar (I don't sync calendar w/Outlook/iTunes), this is quite annoying as I will have to manually enter the event.",
