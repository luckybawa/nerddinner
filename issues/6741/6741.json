I'm trying to use to nerddinner as a model for my own project and have not fiqured out how to get this to work. It works if I'm not using the repository but not with it. Any ideas why you cannot edit a dinner?",

I would think it should not affect the Edit action but Edit is not working and I checked my code with downloaded code and it is exactly same. I am also using VS 2010 ultimate version.\r\n\r\nPlease help me find the solution so I can go ahead with other functionality.",
