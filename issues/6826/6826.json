    "Description": "After logging in to www.nerddinner.com enter the following URL:\n\nhttp://www.nerddinner.com/Dinners/Edit/9999\n\n(9999 is a non-existent number, so it also works with all other non-existent ID's, maybe even negative ones?).\n\nThe generic error page will be displayed. The bug exists in trunk and the fix is fairly easy. In DinnersController.Edit(int id) and immediately after the line:\n\nDinner dinner = dinnerRepository.GetDinner(id.Value);\n\nadd the following lines of code:\n\nif (dinner == null) {\n   return new FileNotFoundResult { Message = \"No Dinner found for that id\" };\n}\n\nRepeat the same in DinnersController.Edit(int id, FormCollection collection). Essentially it is just the same code you already have in place in DinnersController.Details(int id). There you already check whether the dinner exists, and if it doesn't display a user-friendly message (\"NotFound\").",
