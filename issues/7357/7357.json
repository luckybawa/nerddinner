When I first build it it was ok. \nThe issue is that as soon as I modify any file, for example /Views/Home/About.aspx  (I tried adding just blank spaces to some view files) I  get the following error:\n\nHTTP 404. The resource you are looking for (or one of its dependencies) could have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.  Please review the following URL and make sure that it is spelled correctly. \nRequested URL: /Views/Home/About.aspx \n\nCan anyone help me with this?\n\nThanks.",
