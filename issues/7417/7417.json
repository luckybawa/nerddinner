    "Description": "AccountController.Register calls FormsAuth.SignIn, which doesn't provide a mechanism for setting the userData on the forms cookie.  Hence, after a new, non-OpenID user has successfully registered and is redirected to the home page, no \"friendly name\" is displayed at the top of the page, near the \"[Log Off]\" link.\n\nAccountController.LogOn demonstrates the forms cookie creation code necessary to fix this bug.\n\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Open the NerdDinner home page.\n2) Click the Log On link at the top of the page.\n3) On the RHS of the page under \"using a NerdDinner account\", click the Register link.\n4) Supply a Username, Email, and Password.\n5) Click Register.\n6) If necessary, correct any errors and go to Step 5..\n7) Site redirects you back to the home page\n\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe newly-created user's Username will be displayed next to the \"[ Log Off ]\" link.\n\nActual behavior:\n\"Welcome ! [Log Off]\" is displayed (the Username is missing).  (see attached image)\n\n\nNote: when you log off and log back on, the Username displays as expect.  This only occurs immediately after registering a new, non-OpenID user.\n\nI have a fix and will submit a patch.",
