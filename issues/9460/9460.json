Unfortunately, inside the GetCanonicalUsername method, the SqlMembershipProvider returns user.UserName in a case that matches the supplied userName argument.  So without creating a new provider, we're lucky enough to get the correct canonical name with _provider.GetUserNameByEmail(user.Email). Suggested patch attached. Hack? Maybe.",
